== README

This app is the result of following Agile Web Devlopment with Rails 4. Although some of my code is the result of troublehsooting and will be differen't from the book, I would encourage reading the book in its entirety to gain a full grasp of the concepts. Depottut contains the steps up to chapter 20, as the rest of the text is an in depth review of the core structure of Ruby on Rails.
